# UI-Localized-Stretchable

* You no longer need to link your items to your implementation classes to set the NSLocalizedString.
UILabel, UITextView, UITexfield and UIButton use their interface builder text value to get the coresponding NSLocalizedString string. 


* No more deformed image and background image : UIButton image and background and UITextField image are stretched using the vertical and horizontal center of the interface builder image.
